## Seat Adjustment (Business Plan)

### **Included seats**

Business plan includes **5 seats** by default. Add more as your team grows in **Admin Settings â†’ Billing â†’ Overview â†’ Adjust seats.**

### Increase seats

* Additional seats are charged immediately.
* If added mid-cycle, the seat price is prorated for the days remaining in the current billing cycle.

<details>

<summary><strong>What is a Prorated Charge?</strong></summary>

A prorated charge means you pay only for the portion of the billing cycle that the extra seat was in use.&#x20;

For example, if you add a seat halfway through the month, you are charged only for those remaining days, not the full month.

</details>

* Each extra seat adds **Additional Seat Credits** to your monthly total. Credits are granted in full after payment â€” even mid-cycle.

> **Monthly credits = Default monthly credits + Î£(Additional Seat Credits)**

<details>

<summary>Calculation example</summary>

**Business plan includes:** 5 seats and 50,000 default monthly credits

\
**Seat add-on terms:**&#x20;

* $30 per additional seat / month
* 10,000 credits per additional seat / month

**Billing day:** 30th of each month

**Jul 10:** You add **3 seats** (days remaining in cycle: **21/30**)

* Prorated charge (charged immediately): `3 Ã— $30 Ã— 21/30 = $63`
* Additional Seat Credits (granted in full, not prorated): `3 Ã— 10,000 = 30,000 credits`

**Next renewal (Jul 30)**

* **Workspace total seats:** `5 (included) + 3 (added) = 8 seats`
* **Monthly charges:**
  * Base Business subscription (includes 5 seats): **$200/month**
  * 3 additional seats Ã— $30: **$90/month**
  * **Total monthly seat charges:** **$290/month** _(taxes may apply)_
* **Monthly credits:** `50,000 + (3 Ã— 10,000) = 80,000 credits/month`

</details>

### Decrease seats vs. remove members

* Removing a member does not reduce your paid seat count. The seat remains **available to reassign** until the end of the current cycle.
* To decrease seats, update the seat quantity in **Billing â†’ Adjust seats**. The change is scheduled for your next renewal. No refunds for the current cycle.

***

## Types of Credit

Doraverse uses three credit types. They are used in this order: **Free credit â†’ Monthly credit â†’ Prepaid credit**.

### **Free Credit**

* Earned via Doraverse's promotions: trials, referrals or exclusive campaigns.
* Has an expiration (see in **Billing**).

### **Monthly Credit**

* Included with your subscription plan.
* Reset at the start of each billing cycle. Unused monthly credits donâ€™t roll over.

### **Prepaid Credit**

* Purchased via one-time top-ups.
* Stay available as long as the workspace exists.
* Non-refundable.

### When credits run out

If your workspace runs out of credits, AI features become unavailable. Access resumes when your monthly credits reset at the start of the next billing cycle **or** when you top up with Prepaid credits.

Donâ€™t worry â€” weâ€™ll email you when your credits are running low so you have time to top up before anything pauses.

## Change Plans

Workspace Owner and Billing role can switch plans any time. Before confirming, review how the change affects members, seats, and billing.

### **Moving to Business plan**

* **Seats & members:** Multi-seat support turns on and you can add member anytime.
* **Admin access:** Unlock full Admin Settings â€” Reporting (user activity & model usage), Member Management, and Workspace Settings (branding, custom domain, etc.).
* **Billing:** Charge applies immediately. Mid-cycle changes are prorated for the remaining days; any unused amount is credited to your account balance and applied to your next invoice.
* **Credits:** Monthly credits reset to the new plan. Prepaid/free credits remain.

### **Moving to an Individuals plan**

* **Seats & members:** The person who confirms the plan change remains in the workspace (as Owner); all other members are removed immediately and lose access. The workspace seat count is set to 1.
* **Admin access:**&#x20;
  * Access to Reporting (user activity, model usage) is removed.
  * Budget limitations and related settings are deleted.
* **Billing:** Charge applies immediately. Mid-cycle changes are prorated for the remaining days; any unused amount is credited to your account balance and applied to your next invoice.
* **Credits:** Monthly credits reset to the new plan. Prepaid/free credits remain.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important:** These changes are not auto-restored if you switch back later. All removed membersâ€™ data will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.
{% endhint %}

## Cancel Subscription

Canceling schedules your subscription to end at the end of the current billing cycle. Until that date, your workspace remains fully usable.\
You can undo a scheduled cancellation any time before it takes effect in **Billing**.

***

## Billing & Invoices

### **Payment processing**

All payments are handled securely by **Stripe**. Doraverse does not store sensitive card data. You can manage everything in **Account â†’ Admin Settings â†’ Billing**.

### **When youâ€™re charged:**

* **Subscription start/renewal:** Charged on your billing day.&#x20;
* **Change plan:** Charged immediately upon confirmation (prorated if mid-cycle); any unused amount is credited to your account balance and applied to your next invoice.
* **Add more seats:** Charged immediately (prorated if mid-cycle).
* **Top up prepaid credit:** Charged at purchase.

### **Pricing and taxes**&#x20;

All prices are shown and charged in **USD**. Taxes are added at checkout based on your billing address.

### Failed payments

* **Immediate charges** (e.g., Prepaid top-ups, adding seats, upgrades charged now): If the charge fails, the purchase does not complete and no changes are applied. Update your payment method in **Billing** and try again.
* **Subscription renewals:** If the charge fails, weâ€™ll retry automatically and notify you by email. If payment is still unsuccessful after the retry window, your workspace is paused until payment is completed. Access is restored immediately once the payment goes through.

### Manage Billing & Invoices

Go to **Account â†’ Admin Settings â†’ Billing**.\
From there, open **Manage Billing** to:

* View current subscription.
* Update payment methods.
* Update billing details.
* View & download invoice history (invoices and receipts).

> **Who can manage billing:** Only Workspace Owners and Billing role users can view and change these settings.
