### üí¨ Prompt **Library** ( / )&#x20;

Press or type ‚Äú/‚Äù to quickly insert prompts by command or name.\
**To learn more, see our** [**Prompt Library Feature**](https://doraverse.gitbook.io/docs/jp/feature-list/prompt-library)**.**

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Send **Message**

Press the arrow button to send your message and receive a response from the AI.

***

## **Feedback and Action Bar**

The Feedback and Action Bar provides easy ways to interact with each AI response, helping improve the AI model and making your experience more efficient.&#x20;

#### **1. Provide Feedback**

* **Thumbs-Up (Like):** Click this if the AI‚Äôs response is helpful, clear, or accurate. Positive feedback helps the model identify effective responses and reinforce quality answers.
* **Thumbs-Down (Dislike):** Click this if the response is incorrect, incomplete, or confusing. Negative feedback helps the model recognize errors and avoid repeating them in future responses.

#### **2. Suggest Edit**

If the AI‚Äôs response could be clearer, more precise, or better phrased, use the pencil icon to suggest improvements. This helps the model learn preferred styles, wording, and information accuracy.

After making your edits, don‚Äôt forget to click **Save & Submit** to send your suggestions.&#x20;

#### **3. Copy Response**

Use this to quickly copy the AI‚Äôs response for use elsewhere:

* **Copy as Markdown:** Preserves formatting such as headings, lists, and links. Ideal for pasting into markdown-supported platforms.
* **Copy as Plain Text:** Copies the response as simple text without formatting, suitable for plain text editors or emails.

#### **4. Regenerate**

Request a new AI response to the same query. Useful when you want alternative perspectives or refined answers without starting a new conversation.

#### **5. Read Aloud**

Have the AI read the response aloud, convenient for multitasking or accessibility needs.

#### **6. Branch from This**

When you choose Branch from This, you‚Äôre starting a new conversation path from a specific message, lets you explore new ideas from any point.\
You will have three **Fork options** to decide how much of the chat you want to include in your new branch:

* **Visible messages only:** Adds just the direct conversation leading to your selected message.
* **Include related branches:** Includes additional side discussions connected to that part of the conversation.
* **Include all to/from here:** Brings in the entire conversation history and all related branches, giving you complete context.

**Additional Settings:**

* **Start Fork Here:** When checked, branching starts from the selected message and includes all subsequent messages based on the chosen option above.
* **Remember:** Saves your branching preferences for future use, making it faster to fork conversations according to your preferred settings.

## Citations with clickable source links

When using search models (including available search AI models and Doraverse‚Äôs built-in Search/Deep Research tool), you‚Äôll notice **inline citations** (e.g., \[1], \[2]) at the end of each sentence when a response is informed by external information.&#x20;

To verify or explore information further, simply hover over a citation. This allows you to review the original source‚Äîensuring full transparency and reliability in every answer.
