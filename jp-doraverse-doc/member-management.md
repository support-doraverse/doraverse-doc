📌 **Please note:** Only Workspace Owners can change roles.

## Removing Members

Workspace Owners can remove members at any time:

* Find the member in the list.
* Open the Role dropdown next to their name.
* Select **Remove from workspace**.

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Important:

#### What happens when you remove a member

* They lose access to the workspace immediately.
* Their historical data (e.g., chat history, tasks, AI outputs, uploaded files, statistics) remains in the workspace, but their name is replaced with **“Deleted account”** in past activity.
* Their email address is retained in system logs and may be archived for auditing or recovery purposes.
* If re-invited, they will join as a **completely new member** with no link to their previous account.
{% endhint %}

## Workspace Owners Leaving

An Owner cannot leave the workspace if they are the only remaining Owner while other members are still active.

If you want to leave but there are still members, you must either assign another Owner, or remove all members first.

Once the last user leaves, the workspace becomes **Inactive**.\
You’ll have a **30-day grace period** to reactivate by adding members back. After 30 days, the workspace (and its subdomain) will be permanently deleted. Lear more in our [**Term of Service**](https://doraverse.com/article/jp/term-of-service).
