### Step 1: Add Your Sources

A ‚Äúsource‚Äù refers to any document or piece of content you add to the NotebookAI, such as project reports, documents or transcripts.

Each notebook can contain up to 50 sources. Supported file types include PDF, text (.txt), and Markdown.&#x20;

#### Ways to add sources:

* Upload from your computer
* Add from Google Drive\
  If you haven‚Äôt connected your Google Drive yet, see [H**ow to connect your Google Drive to Doraverse**](https://help.doraverse.com/feature-list/chat-with-ai-models#how-to-connect-your-google-drive-to-doraverse)
* Paste content: Copy and paste plain text and Markdown.

### Step 2: Chat with Your Documents

Unlock knowledge with AI-powered Q\&A, following:

* Select one or multiple documents from your sources to interact with.
* Pick your preferred AI model for the conversation.
* Type your question
* Receive fast, reliable answers grounded in your provided information. Each answer includes clickable citations that link directly to the quoted sources, so you can use them with confidence.

**üìå Important note:**

* The AI only uses the materials you have uploaded. Answers do not reference external data.
* Conversations are never stored. Each chat is private and resets with the Refresh button or when you start a new session.

### Step 3: Save to Notes

For any answer you find valuable and want to keep for future reference, simply **save it as a Note.**

Notes help you collect and organize insights, making it easy to revisit findings and share with your team.

#### Managing Notes:

* Access your saved Notes by toggling the button on the top-right of chat.
* Review, organize, or delete Notes as you needed.
* You can convert any Note into a full document (each Note can be converted once).
