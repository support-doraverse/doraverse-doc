* **Theme:** Switch between Light and Dark mode for comfortable viewing based on your environment or preference.
* **Language:** Change the interface language for a more familiar experience.
* **Render user messages as markdown:** Enable to display your messages with markdown formatting (useful for code, lists, and formatting).
* **Auto-Scroll to latest message on chat open:** Turn on to automatically jump to the most recent message each time you open a chat.
* **Hide right-most side panel:** Use this to declutter your screen if you want more focus on the main chat area.
* **Archived chats:** Find and manage your archived conversations for better organization.

## Chat Setting

* **Message Font Size:** Adjust how large the chat text appears for better readability.
* **Chat direction:** Set the direction for your chat input
  *   **LTR (Left-to-Right):**

      Most languages, including English, are written from left to right. This is the default chat direction in Doraverse.
  *   **RTL (Right-to-Left):**

      Some languages, like Arabic and Hebrew, are written from right to left. Doraverse supports RTL for a seamless, natural reading and writing experience.
* **Press Enter to send messages:** When enabled, pressing `ENTER` will send your message. When disabled, pressing Enter will add a new line, and you’ll need to press `CTRL + ENTER` / `⌘ + ENTER` to send your message.
* **Maximize chat space:** Toggle this to instantly expand your chat box to its maximum size, allowing you to focus fully on your conversation.
* **Center Chat Input on Welcome Screen:** This positions the chat input box in the center when you open Doraverse, create a clean look when you first open Doraverse.
* **Always show code when using Code Interpreter:** Enable this to automatically display the code executed by Code Interpreter for every request—giving you greater visibility and control over each step.
* **Parsing LaTeX in Messages:** Enable Parsing LaTeX in Messages to automatically turn LaTeX code into beautifully rendered mathematical equations within your chats. This helps you write and share complex math and scientific formulas with clarity—perfect for technical discussions or collaborative problem-solving.\
  If you don’t need math formatting or want faster performance, you can disable this option to keep messages simple and speed up loading.
* **Save drafts locally:** When enabled, the text and attachments you enter in the chat form will be automatically saved locally as drafts. These drafts will be available even if you reload the page or switch to a different conversation. \
  Drafts are stored locally on your device and are deleted once the message is sent.
* **Scroll to the end button:** Quickly jump to the bottom of a long conversation.
* **Save Badges State:** Enable Save Badges State to keep your chat badges just as you set them—every new chat will start with the same badge settings as your previous chat. Disable it, and badges will reset to their default each time you start a new conversation.
* **Enable Switching Endpoints Mid-Conversation:** Turn on this to seamlessly change the AI model or Agent you’re using within the current chat—giving you the flexibility to adapt to different needs without starting over.
* **Use Default fork option:** lets you create a separate copy of a chat from any message, so you can continue the conversation in a new direction without changing the original conversation.\
  When choose a fork option, you can choose how Doraverse gathers messages:
  * **Visible messages only:** Includes just the direct path to your selected message. Use this for a focused fork that isolates a specific part of the conversation.
  * **Include related branches:** Adds any branches connected along that path. Great when you want additional context or relevant side discussions alongside your main topic.
  * **Include all to/from here:** Gathers all connected messages and branches in both directions. Ideal for comprehensive forks where you need the full context and all related history.
* **Start fork from target message by default:** When this is enabled, your fork will automatically start from the message you choose and include everything up to the latest message, following the fork option you select.

## Personalization&#x20;

The **Personalization** section allows you to make Doraverse feel more tailored to your way of working. You can set up custom instructions for the AI and enable memory so Doraverse can remember details across sessions.

* **Customization:** This lets you guide how Doraverse should respond to you. By adding custom instructions, you can tell Doraverse your preferred style, context about your work, or specific details it should always keep in mind when assisting you.\
  To set this up, click **Customize**, fill in your instructions, and save them.

* **Memory:** Doraverse can remember key details—like your name, preferences, or project goals, to make future chats more tailored and helpful. You can tell Doraverse exactly what to remember by saying things like, “Remember that thing I just have said.”\
  Doraverse also references previous messages in your current session for context. To make sure details last for future chats, use saved memories.\
  To use Memory:
  * **Teach:** Just tell the AI what you want it to remember.\
    &#xNAN;_&#x46;or example: “Remember I’m focused on marketing strategies this quarter.”_
  * **See What’s Remembered** \
    _For example, just ask: “What do you remember about me?” to check your saved details._

**Note:** Turn off saved memories in your settings if you don’t want Doraverse to remember details for future chats, or use **Manage memories** to review, edit, or delete saved information.
