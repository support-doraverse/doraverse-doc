# Chat with AI Models

## **Can I chat with different AI models at the same time?**

In Doraverse you can open multiple chat sessions and select a different AI model for each one. This allows you to leverage the unique strengths of each model for your various business needs.&#x20;

For instructions, see [**Choose AI Model to Chat.**](https://doraverse.gitbook.io/docs/jp/feature-list/chat-with-ai-models#choose-ai-model-to-chat)

You can even compare the responses from different models to the same prompt side-by-side, helping you choose the most suitable result for your task.\

## How do I know which AI model is best for my task?

Each AI model has different strengths.&#x20;

You can refer to our [**Choose AI Model Based on Your Task**](https://doraverse.gitbook.io/docs/jp/help/faqs/chat-with-ai-models/choose-ai-model-based-on-your-task) and [**Choose AI Model Based on Their Capabilities**](https://doraverse.gitbook.io/docs/jp/help/faqs/chat-with-ai-models/choose-ai-model-based-on-their-capabilities) guide or consult with your admin to select the best model for your specific task.

## What AI models are available to chat with?

Doraverse provides access to the world’s leading and most advanced large language models, helping your business stay ahead in productivity and innovation.

See [**Doraverse Available AI Models**](https://doraverse.gitbook.io/docs/jp/feature-list/available-ai-models) for more details.

***

## Can I save or export the chat conversations for future reference?

Yes, you can export chats as text files or save them within Doraverse for easy access and review later. For detailed steps, please see the [**Share/Export Conversation**](https://doraverse.gitbook.io/docs/jp/feature-list/chat-with-ai-models#conversation-options-three-dot-menu) page.

***

## Can I customize the AI responses to fit my department’s needs?

You can create a dedicated AI Agent, essentially a personalized AI assistant—designed to handle specific tasks relevant to your department. These Agents can understand your team’s unique objectives, workflows, language, requirements, and delivering tailored responses and automating routine processes like report generation, customer support, data analysis, or content creation.&#x20;

To get started and learn more about how AI Agents can enhance your work, visit the **AI Agents in Doraverse**.

***

## Is there a limit to the number or length of conversations I can have?

Limits are managed through a credit system set by your workspace admin. Credits represent your usage allowance and are calculated based on factors such as message volume or the specific AI model used. Each conversation consumes credits accordingly.&#x20;

Your admin allocates credits at both the workspace and individual user levels to ensure fair and efficient use of the platform. For more details, please contact your admin.

***

## Can I get recommendations on which AI model to use for specific tasks?

Yes, Doraverse provides guidance and examples for model selection. See the **Model Recommendations** page for more details.

***

## How frequently are the AI models updated or improved?

When a provider releases an updated or new model, the Doraverse team carefully tests and optimizes it to ensure the best performance and efficiency on our platform. Once validated, the model is added to our available list. All updates are documented in our **Change Log** for your reference.

***

## What should I do if I encounter an error message while chatting with a model?

Error messages can occur due to various reasons such as network issues, browser settings, or system disruptions. To troubleshoot common errors and find step-by-step solutions, please visit our **Error Messages Troubleshooting** page.

## **Why is my AI response cut off or incomplete?**

An AI response may be cut off or incomplete for several reasons:

1. **Exceeding the model’s maximum response length limit**
   1. **For standard models (models provided by the platform)**:\
      The maximum response length for each model is fixed by default and cannot be modified. However, you can guide the AI to deliver longer answers by adjusting your prompt, for example:
      * Ask the AI to split its answer into multiple parts and send them sequentially. For instance:\
        &#xNAN;_“Split my response into four parts. Send me the first part now, and wait for me to type ‘next’ before sending the next.”_
        * Use instructions like _“reply with X paragraphs”_ or _“maximum X words”_ to control response length.
   2. **For custom agents you or your team have created:**\
      You can increase the **Max tokens output** parameter in the agent’s model settings to allow longer responses.
2. **Network issues**

A slow or unstable internet connection can interrupt the data stream from the AI, causing incomplete replies.

3. **Server-side problems**

Occasional issues on the servers hosting the AI can lead to responses being cut off or delayed.

4. **Prompt length**

Very long or complex prompts use more tokens upfront, which can cause the model to reach its token limit before finishing the reply.

## How do I provide feedback on the AI model’s responses?

You can easily share your feedback by clicking the like or dislike icon in the [**Feedback and Action Bar**](https://doraverse.gitbook.io/documents/feature-list/chat-with-ai-models#feedback-and-action-bar) below each response.

***

## Can I connect my Google Drive to Doraverse?

Yes, you can connect Google Drive to Doraverse to send files directly in chat without manual uploading. Easily manage this connection by navigating to **Account > Settings > Connected App**.

_**Note:**_ To connect, you will need to grant Doraverse permission to access your Google Drive. For your security, Doraverse only accesses files you explicitly select, with strong privacy and security protections in place.

## Is there a limit to how many images I can create?

You may have a daily or monthly limit on image generation, depending on the limits set by your administrators. Please check with your admin or review your plan details for more information.

***

## Can I use images I’ve created for commercial purposes?

Yes, you can use images generated by Doraverse’s AI models for commercial purposes, including selling, publishing, and merchandising. Please review Doraverse’s [**Terms of Service** ](https://doraverse.gitbook.io/docs/jp/policies/terms-of-service)for full guidance on commercial usage and any potential restrictions.

## Are all answers provided with citations?

No, citations only appear when a response includes information obtained from external sources. In Doraverse, only search models, such as built-in Search, Deep Research tools or specialized search models like Sonar Deep Research, provide responses with inline citations and clickable source links.
