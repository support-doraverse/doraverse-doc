description: Set up your custom domain on Doraverse

# Custom Domain

In Doraverse, you can set up a custom domain (like `ai.my-domain.com` or `work.my-domain.com`) so your workspace is easier to remember, access, and truly feels like your own.

> üìå Please note:
>
> Doraverse doesn‚Äôt sell domains or replace your current domain provider. You‚Äôll need a domain that you already own and manage elsewhere. Doraverse simply connects your domain to your chosen custom domain.

Below is a step-by-step guide to get you up and running.

### Step 1: Access Your Admin Workspace

From your home screen, go to: Account ‚Üí Admin Settings ‚Üí Workspace Settings ‚Üí Domain.&#x20;

### Step 2: Enter Your Custom Domain

There are a few important rules to follow when adding your custom domain to ensure a smooth setup:

* You must already own your domain (bought from domain registrars like Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.).
*   Include a subdomain when entering your custom domain, such as:

    `wwww.my-domain.com`\
    `work.my-domain.net`\
    Any subdomain is fine (e.g., `chat.my-domain.com`)

In the example:&#x20;

* `aidol.social` is your root domain (sometimes called your main domain)
* `work` is the subdomain prefix ‚Äî this is the part you add in front of your main domain.

üëâ  Together, your full subdomain becomes `work.aidol.social`       &#x20;

> ‚ùìWhy a subdomain?
>
> Most providers require a subdomain (the part before the main domain, like ‚Äúwww‚Äù or ‚Äúportal‚Äù) for the connection to work properly.

Click **Add Domain**. Doraverse will show you the exact DNS record you‚Äôll need to add to your domain provider.

### Step 3: Set Up a CNAME Record with Your Domain Provider

* Go to your domain registrar‚Äôs dashboard (where you manage your domain). Find the settings called DNS Records or Host Records.
* Create a CNAME record with the details provided by Doraverse:
  * Host/Name: Copy the ‚ÄúName‚Äù shown in Doraverse.
  * Value/Points to: Copy the ‚ÄúValue‚Äù shown in Doraverse.
  * TTL (Time To Live): You can leave TTL on ‚ÄúAutomatic,‚Äù which works fine for most users. If you want your changes to update more quickly, set TTL to a low value like 5 minutes.&#x20;

Save your changes. DNS records might take sometime to update.

### Step 4: Check Your Connection

Return to the Domain setting space in Doraverse. Click **Check.**\
If everything is set up correctly, your workspace is now live at your custom address.

You can always change the custom domain later. Just repeat the setup steps carefully to update your settings.

### üí° Tips: Fixing "Domain Name Mismatch Detected"&#x20;

If you enter this error, it means: Doraverse checked your DNS settings and found the CNAME or domain name you entered doesn't match what‚Äôs in your DNS provider‚Äôs records.

### How to Fix:

* Double-check the domain/subdomain you typed. Make sure it matches exactly (no typos, extra spaces, or missing words). Do not include https:// or http:// (That is a link, not a domain name)
* Ensure you have added the **CNAME record** exactly as shown by Doraverse:\
  Type: CNAME\
  Name/Host: Copy what‚Äôs shown (example: work)\
  Value/Points to: Copy the full value (example: clsb31ax1.doraverse.com)
* Don‚Äôt use your root domain (like mycompany.com) as the CNAME "Name" unless instructed.
* Wait a few minutes and retry ‚Äî sometimes DNS updates aren‚Äôt instant.
