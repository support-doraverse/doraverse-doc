### "Download failed" / "File Not Found."

This error occurs when attempting to download files or click on file links generated by the platform.

* For custom AI agents, please ensure that the necessary capabilities to generate and enable file downloads are properly enabled and up to date:
  * **Run Code under the Code Interpreter API**, which allows the agent to execute code and create files programmatically.
  * **Enable Artifacts**, which lets the agent deliver generated files directly within the chat interface for seamless downloading.

Both capabilities must be enabled in your Agent’s settings to support file generation and downloading.

* Confirm the file was recently generated, as files may expire quickly.
* Disable VPNs or proxy connections.
