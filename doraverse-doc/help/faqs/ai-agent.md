# AI Agent

## **What are Agents in Doraverse?**

Agents in Doraverse are intelligent assistants that use AI to pursue goals and complete tasks on behalf of users. They demonstrate reasoning, planning, memory, and autonomy—allowing them to make decisions, learn, and adapt over time.&#x20;

Powered by advanced generative AI and large language models (LLMs), Doraverse Agents are tailored by combining clear instructions with company- or industry-specific knowledge and capabilities, enabling you to build sophisticated assistants without coding. They support a wide range of activities, from everyday business tasks to technical support.&#x20;

While similar to ChatGPT’s GPTs, Doraverse Agents offer broader AI model options and a no-code setup, making it easy to create powerful assistants without programming.

***

## **Do I need to know how to code to create an Agent?**

No, coding skills are not required at all. Doraverse makes creating and customizing agents accessible to non-technical users from any field and anyone on your team.&#x20;

***

## What types of tasks can an AI Agent perform?

An AI Agent in Doraverse can handle a wide range of tasks designed to boost your productivity, streamline workflows, automate repetitive work, and reduce manual effort.&#x20;

To learn more about how different teams use AI Agents, explore our **AI Agent Use Case** where we showcase examples across customer support, employee productivity, creative work, data analysis, coding, security, automation, and more.

***

## **How do I create an Agent?**

You can start building an Agent easily by accessing the AI Agent feature from the Navigation bar. From there, you provide clear instructions on what the Agent should do, upload files containing your company- or industry-specific knowledge to build its knowledge base, adjust model parameters, and select the capabilities that best suit your workflow.&#x20;

For detailed instructions, please refer to the step-by-step guide [**here**](https://doraverse.gitbook.io/docs/feature-list/ai-agents#step-by-step-guide-to-build-your-own-ai-agent-in-doraverse)**.**

***

## Can I train the AI Agent with company-specific data or workflows?

Yes, you can tailor your AI Agent to your company’s or team’s unique needs by providing relevant data and clear instructions.&#x20;

Simply upload documents, reports, FAQs, or other materials that reflect your business context for File Search to create the agent’s knowledge base. The AI Agent uses this content to deliver answers and perform tasks specific and relevant to your workflows.&#x20;

***

## Can multiple employees collaborate on building or improving an AI Agent?

Absolutely! Doraverse encourages collaboration. Multiple team members can view, edit, or update AI Agents based on the sharing permissions you set.&#x20;

For more details on managing access, please refer to the [**Set Sharing & Permissions section for Agents.**](https://doraverse.gitbook.io/docs/feature-list/ai-agents#id-6.-set-sharing-and-permissions)

***

## What happens if the AI Agent makes a mistake or provides incorrect information?

While AI Agents are designed for accuracy and reliability, errors can occur, especially with complex or unusual queries. Because the agent’s performance depends on how it’s set up, providing clear, specific instructions helps minimize mistakes. You can also adjust model parameters to improve its responses. Regular testing and refinement are essential to maintaining an effective AI Agent.

***

## Can Agents in Doraverse be integrated with or accessed on my company websites?

Yes! Soon you will be able to embed specific AI Agents as chat widgets on other websites. This upcoming feature will let you bring your custom assistant directly to your preferred platforms, making interaction seamless and convenient.

You can check the our latest **Changelog** for updates.

***

## Can the AI Agent show results visually?

Yes! By enabling the [**Artifact**](https://doraverse.gitbook.io/docs/feature-list/ai-agents/agents-capabilities/artifact) capability in the Agent’s settings, your AI Agent can generate and display complex visuals such as Mermaid diagrams, website prototypes, and interactive UI components for React and HTML.&#x20;

These visuals are presented in a separate UI window to improve clarity and make interaction with the content easier and more intuitive.

***

## Can I download output files generated by the AI Agent?

Absolutely! When you enable the [**Code Interpreter capability**](https://doraverse.gitbook.io/docs/feature-list/ai-agents/agents-capabilities/code-interpreter) in the Agent’s settings, the AI Agent can run code to create files like reports or data outputs, which you can download directly.&#x20;

It also securely handles file uploads and processing within your session.

***

## Can Artifact and Code Interpreter be used together?

Absolutely! Combining both allows your AI Agent to generate code (via Code Interpreter) and immediately visualize the results in a separate UI window (via Artifact) for a powerful interactive experience.

***

## How often should I update or retrain my AI Agent?

It’s a good practice to regularly review and update your AI Agent to keep it aligned with changing business needs, new data, or evolving workflows. You should update it whenever there are significant changes in your company’s processes, policies, or knowledge base.

Retraining or refining the agent periodically helps improve accuracy and responsiveness, especially if you receive feedback indicating misunderstandings or errors. Regular testing and iteration ensure your AI Agent remains a valuable, reliable assistant.

***

## Can the Agent remember previous conversations or tasks?

By default, an AI Agent processes and responds based on the immediate conversation context within a single chat session. To provide continuity across interactions or ongoing projects, training the model through updates to its instructions or knowledge base is typically required.&#x20;

However, Doraverse offers an advanced **Memory** feature that enables your AI Agent to retain information from prior conversations. This capability allows the agent to deliver personalized, context-aware responses over time, enhancing collaboration and project continuity.&#x20;

For privacy and control, you can choose to enable or disable this memory feature as needed.
