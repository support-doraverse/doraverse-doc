## Key Model Capabilities to Consider

### Modalities (Input & Output)

Modality means the type or format of data an AI model can process as input and produce as output.

### Maximum Context Length (Context Window)

Context Length refers to how much information (e.g., words or tokens) a model can “consider” at once when producing an output.

* **Short Context (up to \~1,000 tokens):** Perfect for simple tasks like answering short queries, classifying emails, or recognizing objects in small images.
* **Medium Context (around 2,000-4,000 tokens):** Useful for handling longer documents, paragraphs, or multi-turn conversations, like summarizing reports or supporting chatbots.
* **Long Context (10,000+ tokens or more):** Enables deep understanding of lengthy documents, complex conversations, or large datasets. It ideal for legal document reviews, books, or extensive customer support dialogs.

**Tips:** Match context length to your workload. Longer contexts improve understanding but usually come with higher computational cost and latency.

## Intelligence

Intelligence refers to how effectively an AI model understands, processes, and generates information to meet your task requirements. It encompasses accuracy, contextual comprehension, reasoning ability, and adaptability.&#x20;

One common way to measure intelligence is the **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)** score, which evaluates a model’s performance across a wide range of academic and professional tasks. Higher MMLU scores indicate stronger language comprehension and problem-solving abilities, helping you gauge which model best fits your needs.

### Speed and Latency

Speed is how fast an AI model can complete a given task or process a piece of data.&#x20;

Latency is the delay between submitting a request to the AI model and receiving a response.&#x20;

These performance aspects are critical depending on the use case: for example, real-time applications like chatbots require low latency for seamless interactions, while batch processing tasks can tolerate higher latency.&#x20;

**Tips:** Understanding speed and latency helps you select models that deliver timely responses without overloading resources.

### Cost

Cost depends on the amount of data processed by the AI model, measured in tokens. Input token cost is the expense for processing the data you send, while output token cost covers the tokens the model generates in response. These are usually billed per 1,000 tokens.&#x20;

**Tips:** Understanding token usage helps you manage expenses and get the most value from your AI.

### Key Features

AI models often come with specialized features and skills designed to enhance their performance on particular tasks. Understanding these unique capabilities can help you choose a model that fits your needs precisely.

### **Best Suited Use Cases**

Different AI models shine in different applications. Matching their strengths with your business needs is key.
