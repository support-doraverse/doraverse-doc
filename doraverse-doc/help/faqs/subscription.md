</details>

What’s included in my Base Subscription?

A base sub A flat-fee plan (monthly or upcoming annual) covering up to 5 seats plus a bundle of monthly AI-usage credits. Full access to all Doraverse features is included.

How do Credits work?

– Credits power every AI feature and are consumed in this order:

Monthly credits (reset each cycle)\
Prepaid credits (never expire)\
Free/promotional credits (time-limited per program)\
How can I top up Credits or cover overages?

– Purchase prepaid credits in your dashboard. They’re used only after your monthly credits are exhausted.

What happens if I exceed my included seats?

– Inviting a 6th (or beyond) member automatically adds a seat and incurs the per-seat fee, pro-rated for the remainder of the billing cycle. Charges appear on your next invoice.

Can I remove a seat mid-cycle?

– Yes. Removing a user does not cancel the seat charge; that seat remains active (and reassignable) through the cycle’s end. No refunds, but you can swap in another member at no extra cost.

How does the 14-Day Free Trial work?

– New workspaces get 14 days of full-feature access + up to $20 trial credits (no card required). Trial ends after 14 days or upon subscription. Any unused trial credits convert to free credits (valid 90 days) or are held 90 days if you don’t subscribe.

How do I change my Subscription plan?

– To upgrade or switch (e.g., monthly → annual), go to Account → Admin → Billing and select “Change Plan.” Pro-rated charges apply for mid-cycle upgrades.
