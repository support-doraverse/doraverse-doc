# Overview

The Overview tab in Doraverse Workspace Management is your home base for workspace health. The Overview tab shows status, plan, usage, and shortcuts in one clean screen.

## What you’ll see:

* **Your Current Plan:** Current plan, active status, renewal timing, with inline actions to **Change plan** and **Edit period**.
* **Monthly credits:** A real‑time progress bar for credits used vs. remaining, reset timing, and a quick link to **Purchase credits**.
* **Members & seats:** Simple visibility into current members compared with paid seats, plus a shortcut to **Manage members.**
* **Quick access: Open Doraverse** to jump into work, **Billing** for payments and invoices, and **Usage Limits** to set budget guardrails.
