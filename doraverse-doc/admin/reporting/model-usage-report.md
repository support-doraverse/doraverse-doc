## **How to Use Report by Models:**

1. **Filter by Time, Provider, and Model**\
   Select your desired **Time Range**, **Provider**, and **AI Model** at the top to narrow your analysis to a specific period, source, or model.
2. **Review Key Metrics for Each Model**\
   The main table displays detailed metrics for every AI model in use:

* **Model:** The name (and icon) of the AI model for easy identification.
* **Code:** The specific model version or code.
* **Total Messages:** The number of messages processed by each model, indicating its utilization and workload.
* **Amount Spent:** The total cost incurred for each model, helping you track resource allocation.
* **Cost Per Message:** The average cost per message, making it easy to compare efficiency and value across models.

## ðŸ’¡**Tip**

Leverage this insight to:

* Optimize AI usage and assign the best-suited models to each department or task.
* Compare cost-efficiency between models to inform budgeting and resource allocation.
* Identify which models are most used and which incur the highest costs.
