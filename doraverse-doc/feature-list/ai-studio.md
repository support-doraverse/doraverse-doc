**💡 Tips**: Pay special attention to the last line. This is the AI prompt used to generate the image. It’s a helpful reference if you want to recreate, tweak, or reuse the prompt in the future.

## Video Generation with Studio

Create high-quality videos, fast, right inside Doraverse Studio. We add the most advanced video models and keep them current, so what you use today is the best you can get.

### What you can make

* **Text → Video**: describe the scene and let the model do the magic.
* **Image / Multi-image → Video**: animate a single look or stitch a light storyboard.

📌 Note: Some models handle both text and image inputs (e.g. Veo 3, Seedance). Others are image-to-video only (e.g. Kling Pro). Peek at the model card first — capabilities and limits are clearly listed.

### To generate a video **(same flow as Image Generation)**

* Pick a model: Check the description card for each model’s strengths, supported formats, and cost.
* Upload images (optional): Skip this if you’re going pure text-to-video.
* Type your prompt.
* Set the specs: Choose aspect ratio, size, duration, and audio (if the model exposes it).

You can also make a video from your Studio image by opening your image → choose **Make Video** and repeat the same flow.
