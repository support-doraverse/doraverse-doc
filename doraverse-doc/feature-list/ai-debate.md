# AI Debate

## What is Debate in Doraverse?

Debate is a fresh way to work with multiple AI models in Doraverse. Instead of receiving a single response, Debate lets several models challenge each other and refine their viewpoints. This gives you deeper insights, fewer blind spots, and a more reliable final answer.

Debate is designed to support users who want multi-perspective reasoning and clearer decision-making in their day-to-day work.

## How Debate works

In Doraverse, Debate is a structured, multi-model discussion. Each model responds in sequence and builds on the previous response, working together like an “AI review team.”\
The first model you choose creates the core answer.\
The following models act as critical reviewers: they look for missing angles, question weak or risky assumptions, and highlight areas that need clarity. Each reviewer adds challenge, depth, and new perspectives to the discussion.

This process transforms a single answer into a richer analysis — more angles explored, fewer blind spots, and a final conclusion you can trust more.

## How Debate helps your everyday work

Debate improves clarity and decision-making in many situations:

* Understand complex topics from multiple angles
* Compare solutions and spot risks earlier
* Reduce bias by letting models challenge one another
* Get stronger reasoning instead of one isolated reply
* Save time switching between models manually
* Build more confident proposals, briefs, reports, and documents

3. **Start the debate**\
   Each model will take its turn to think and debate. You can click on each model’s card to open a UI window on the right and see its full thinking process: how it analyzes the topic, how it challenges or refines previous claims, where it agrees or disagrees, and how its arguments evolve over time.

4. **Read the Summary**\
   After all models have finished debating, Doraverse generates a final summary that brings together the strongest points from the discussion. You can save it, continue refining, or use it directly in your work.
