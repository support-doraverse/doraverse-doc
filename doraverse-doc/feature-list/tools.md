The Personalization in Doraverse lets you customize how all AI models interact with you. From setting a nickname and title to defining the traits and communication style that resonate with your personality, you have the power to create an AI experience tailored exclusively to you.&#x20;

With your preferences securely in place, you won’t need to repeat information — Doraverse remembers the context and continuously provides answers that align with your unique needs.

Modify these settings anytime to keep your interactions fresh, personalized, and effortlessly connected to you.

## AI Canvas

**AI Canvas** is an AI‑powered visual panel in Doraverse where AI agents render and execute generated artifacts — from JSON configurations and UI components to full pages, charts, and documents.

Each AI Canvas opens as a separate UI window in your chat, running outputs like JSON and HTML/CSS/JS and turning them into live UI previews, charts, and other visuals next to your messages. No extra setup — just describe what you want and watch it build.

### Who AI Canvas is for:

AI Canvas fits teams who turn ideas into working interfaces and experiences:

* **Developers & frontend engineers:** code HTML/CSS/JS or JSON configs and see them as live UI.
* **Product & UX:** explore flows and screens as interactive canvases, not static specs.
* **Data & Ops:** Turn queries, CSVs, and configs into interactive charts, tables, and internal dashboards with downloadable files.
* **Marketing & Content:** shape landing pages and email layouts with instant visual feedback.

### What you can do with AI Canvas:

* Dashboards and reports with filters, tooltips, and dark mode
* CSV to live report, with KPI tiles, trends, cohorts, outliers and more
* Email HTML with branded styling
* Campaign microsites and landing pages — responsive and fast
* React components and app screens (forms, tabs, modals, validation,...)
* Diagrams and data stories—org charts, architecture maps, funnels
* Knowledge and help — product tours, interactive guides, JSON/log viewers

...and endless use cases are waiting for you. If you can imagine it, AI Canvas can bring it to life.

## Web Search & Code Interpreter

Doraverse now uses **Automatic tool orchestratio**n to make **Web Search and a built‑in Code Interpreter available to every AI model by default**.&#x20;

That means any model can search the web for the latest info (news, images) with inline citations, and write/run Python for file handling, coding, and charts. No manual tool toggles, no worrying about a model’s native browsing or coding support.
