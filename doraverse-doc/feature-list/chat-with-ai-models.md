## Choose AI Model to chat

Instantly switch between powerful AI models to get the best response for every task — writing, coding, searching, and more.

At the bottom-right corner of the prompt input bar, click the model dropdown to view available LLM models and versions. Each model includes a brief description of its strengths and ideal use cases, so you can quickly choose the one that best fits your needs.

## Chat Toolbar

The Chat Toolbar offers a powerful set of tools and shortcuts to help you interact seamlessly with the AI Models. Here’s a quick overview of each button available in the Doraverse's chat bar:

### Upload File (📎)

Easily upload and share files with AI in chat to support your conversations. Click the  (📎) icon in your chat toolbar to access two options:

* **Upload from computer:** Choose files stored locally on your device.
* **Connect to Google Drive:** Select files directly from your Google Drive for instant integration.<br>

* Option 2: Go to **Account** -> **Settings** -> **Connected apps** -> Find **Google Drive** and click **Connect**.

After selecting Google Drive, you may be prompted to sign in and enable Doraverse access.

## **Feedback and Action Bar**

The Feedback and Action Bar provides easy ways to interact with each AI response, helping improve the AI model and making your experience more efficient.&#x20;

#### **1. Provide Feedback**

* **Thumbs-Up (Like):** Click this if the AI’s response is helpful, clear, or accurate. Positive feedback helps the model identify effective responses and reinforce quality answers.
* **Thumbs-Down (Dislike):** Click this if the response is incorrect, incomplete, or confusing. Negative feedback helps the model recognize errors and avoid repeating them in future responses.

#### **2. Suggest Edit**

If the AI’s response could be clearer, more precise, or better phrased, use the pencil icon to suggest improvements. This helps the model learn preferred styles, wording, and information accuracy.

After making your edits, don’t forget to click **Save & Submit** to send your suggestions.&#x20;

#### **3. Copy Response**

Use this to quickly copy the AI’s response for use elsewhere:

* **Copy as Markdown:** Preserves formatting such as headings, lists, and links. Ideal for pasting into markdown-supported platforms.
* **Copy as Plain Text:** Copies the response as simple text without formatting, suitable for plain text editors or emails.

#### **4. Regenerate**

Request a new AI response to the same query. Useful when you want alternative perspectives or refined answers without starting a new conversation.

#### **5. Read Aloud**

Have the AI read the response aloud, convenient for multitasking or accessibility needs.

#### **6. Branch from This**

When you choose **Branch from This**, you’re starting a new conversation path from a specific message, letting you explore new ideas from any point in the chat.

When you branch from a message, a **new conversation** is created that includes **all messages from the beginning of the chat up to the selected message**. Messages after that point are not included in the new conversation, so you can explore a different direction while keeping the original thread unchanged.

This gives you:

* A clean, focused conversation that stops exactly at the message you chose.
* Full context leading up to that point, so no important information is lost.
* The freedom to try alternative prompts, instructions, or ideas from a meaningful checkpoint in the conversation.

## Citations with clickable source links

When using search models (including available search AI models and Doraverse’s built-in Search/Deep Research tool), you’ll notice **inline citations** (e.g., \[1], \[2]) at the end of each sentence when a response is informed by external information.&#x20;

To verify or explore information further, simply hover over a citation. This allows you to review the original source—ensuring full transparency and reliability in every answer.

The **Conversation Sideba**r is your conversation central navigation hub, helping you seamlessly switch between conversations and projects, stay organized and manage your work more efficiently.
