# AI Scheduled Tasks

Task automation used to feel too technical—built for coders or big companies with IT teams.\
With **Doraverse Scheduled Tasks,** that changes.

## What is Doraverse Scheduled Tasks?

**Doraverse Scheduled Tasks** are a no-code way to put repetitive tasks and simple workflows on autopilot in minutes.

With **Scheduled Tasks**, anyone can set up a task where AI runs the workflow end to end—with no coding and no setup headaches:

* AI can use Web Search, Code Interpreter, and Artifact so your task can research, analyze, generate, and deliver outputs automatically.
* AI follows your instructions and processes the work step by step, the same way you’d do it—day or night, on schedule.
* When it’s done, Doraverse sends you an email notification with a link to access the result.

### Examples of Scheduled Tasks you can run in Doraverse

* Daily market & competitor research: Track market changes and competitors every day, then send a consolidated summary report.
* Daily information digest: Compile fresh updates such as stock movements, rankings/leaderboards, or industry news into a quick brief.
* File maintenance and updates: Automatically update spreadsheets, generate new files, or refresh recurring reports.

With Scheduled Tasks, you get an AI assistant that thinks, acts, and integrates directly into your daily work.

## Create Scheduled Tasks in Doraverse

From the conversation sidebar, click **Scheduled Tasks** to open the **Scheduled Tasks Hub**.

In Scheduled Tasks Hub, click **+ Add New** (or **Create your first Scheduled Task** if this is your first one).

### 1. Set up a scheduled task

* **Name:** Use something clear, like “Weekly Meeting Summary to Slack”.
* **Frequency:** Once / Daily / Weekly / Monthly\
  **Time:** HH:MM (24-hour format)
* **Choose your AI model:** Select a Provider and Model that fits your workflow.
* **Send email when completed:** Turn this on if you want Doraverse to email you when the scheduled task finishes.
* **Tools (optional, but powerful):** Enhance your scheduled task using Doraverse built-in tools:
  * **Web Search:** When the task needs to look up information online
  * **Code Interpreter:** For spreadsheets, CSVs, calculations, charts creation or data processing.
  * **Artifact:** To generate interactive outputs (e.g., diagrams, HTML pages, a web/app demo)
* **Scheduled Task Instructions:** Describe the task in plain language. The clearer you are, the better the results.\
  Use this structure as a starting point:
  * **Goal:** What should this scheduled task deliver?
  * **Sources:** Which apps/files should it read?
  * **Steps:** List the actions in order.
  * **Output:** Required format and tone.
  * **Delivery:** Where should it send the result?

### 2. Run Test

Click **Run Test** in the preview panel. The AI will execute the task once so you can review the result. Adjust instructions, tools, or model if needed.

### 3. Create Scheduled Tasks

When everything looks good, click **Create Scheduled Tasks**. Your scheduled task is now live.

From Scheduled Tasks Hub, you can:

* Monitor execution and status
* View logs and outputs
* Pause, resume, or edit your scheduled task at any time

### Multiply Your Productivity with Scheduled Task

Start with a few basic tasks, run tests, and keep refining the instructions until the results match exactly what you want.&#x20;

**Once a Scheduled Task is dialed in, it can save you hours every day**—and when you multiply that across dozens of scheduled tasks running reliably in the background, your productivity increases dramatically.
