# Code Interpreter

### What is Code Interpreter?

**Code Interpreter** is a powerful feature in Doraverse that provides a secure and hassle-free way to execute code and handle files via a simple interface.&#x20;

It offers a versatile sandbox environment for running code in languages like Python, JavaScript, Go, and more — all without requiring local installs or server maintenance.

### How Code Interpreter Works

Imagine you have a virtual assistant who can not only understand your questions but can also write and run small computer programs to help get things done — like organizing data, making calculations, or creating reports.

Here is how the Code Interpreter "assistant" works:

* When you ask the AI to perform a task involving code (like creating charts, diagrams, or files such as CSV reports) it generates the code (for example, Python scripts) using the Code Interpreter. This code is safely written and executed inside a protected space called a sandbox, all right within your chat interface.
* Not only does it provide the code, it can also create files you can download and keeps them organized through session-based storage.
* Plus, you can upload your own files, have the Code Interpreter process them with code, and then receive new or updated files to download—all securely and seamlessly.

In short, the Code Interpreter lets your AI do the “coding and computing” behind the scenes so you get fast, accurate answers or outputs with minimal effort.

### Key Features of Code Interpreter in Doraverse

#### Code Execution

* Execute code in multiple languages including Python, Node.js (JS/TS), Go, C/C++, Java, PHP, Rust, Fortran, and Rscript.
* Run code snippets dynamically and receive standard output, error streams, and detailed execution statistics such as memory usage and CPU time.
* Manage execution status, program arguments, and results securely within isolated sandbox environments.

#### File Handling

* Upload input files for processing and download the generated outputs seamlessly.
* List, delete, and organize files within session-based file management for efficient workspace handling.
* Securely manage files throughout the lifecycle of code execution sessions without manual intervention.
