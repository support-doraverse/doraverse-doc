# AI Integration

When your work lives in scattered tabs: email here, docs there, CRM somewhere else — you lose time and context every time you switch. Decisions slow down, details get missed, and “quick updates” turn into an hour of copying, pasting, and double-checking.

The solution is simple: Connect your apps to Doraverse and work from one place.

### About Doraverse's Integrations

Integration in Doraverse lets you connect to your apps (with your permission) so the AI can fetch data, get context, take actions, and close loops end-to-end, without you juggling apps.

**Connect 50+ apps**, including:

* **Google Workspace**: Gmail, Drive, Sheets, Slides, Calendar, Meet
* **Microsoft365**: Outlook
* **Work Management and Productivity:** Notion, Slack
* **Sales & Ops**: HubSpot
* **Engineering**: GitHub

…with more coming soon.

## Connect an app with Integration

From the home screen chat bar, open **Manage Integrations** to see the list of apps you can connect. Click **Connect** on the one you choose.

You’ll be redirected to a **Composio** consent screen to sign in via OAuth and review the requested scopes. We recommend granting only the minimum necessary scopes — you can expand them later and revoke access at any time.&#x20;

Approve, and you’ll return to Doraverse with the app connected.

📌 Note: Composio is our SOC 2 partner for OAuth. To learn about scopes, storage, and revoking access, see our[ **Integration - Data Control.**](../help/faqs/integration-data-controls.md)

## Use your connected apps

Open **Manage Integrations** and choose the connected app(s) you want to use. You can select multiple apps so that the AI can work across them.

When you enter **Integration mode**, Doraverse automatically switches the model to **Doraverse Integration** for best performance.

Then, just ask AI to get your task done.
