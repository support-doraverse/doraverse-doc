## What is AI Notetaker?

AI Notetaker is your meeting sidekick that handles the boring bits: notes and next steps — so your team stays focused in the conversation and executes faster after.

### What AI Notetaker does

* Turn live meetings or imported recordings into a full transcript and clear, structured notes.
* Keep meetings organized and easy to find with tags.
* Generate actionable tasks from the discussion: titles, details, assignees, and due dates — all fully editable.
* Make meetings searchable, shareable, and accountable.

* **Action Items:** All tasks generated from meetings.

#### Capture a meeting

When you’re ready, click **New Meeting**. Choose how you want to capture:

* **Record Meeting:** Let AI Notetaker records live session and take notes while you stay focused.
* **Import Meeting:** Upload an existing recording for processing. Supported formats: mp4, mp3, mov.

After recording or importing, the AI will prepare a full transcript, structure your notes, and suggest action items.

#### Review and refine

* **Add tags** (e.g: team, project, quarter) to keep sessions organized and easy to find later.
