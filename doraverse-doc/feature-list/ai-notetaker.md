## What is AI Notetaker?

AI Notetaker is your meeting sidekick that handles the boring bits: notes and next steps — so your team stays focused in the conversation and executes faster after.

It captures your meetings, turns them into clear, structured notes, and helps you bridge language gaps with **real-time translation** and easy sharing options.

### What AI Notetaker does

* Turn live meetings or imported recordings into a full transcript and clear, structured notes.
* Translate meetings in real time into your preferred language while the conversation is happening.
* Keep meetings organized and easy to find with tags.
* Generate actionable tasks from the discussion: titles, details, assignees, and due dates — all fully editable.
* Make meetings searchable, shareable, and accountable.
* Share meeting notes via email so you can review and forward them easily.

## Get started with AI Notetaker in Doraverse

* **Action Items:** All tasks generated from meetings.

#### Capture a meeting

When you’re ready, click **New Meeting**. Choose how you want to capture:

* **Online Meeting:** Let AI Notetaker record a live call from tools like Zoom or Google Meet right from your browser, so you can stay focused on the conversation.
* **In‑Person Meeting:** Use your computer’s microphone to capture a face‑to‑face discussion in the room and turn it into searchable notes.
* **Upload Recording:** Upload an existing audio or video file for processing. Supported formats: mp4, mp3, mov.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After recording or importing, the AI will prepare a full transcript, structure your notes, and suggest action items.

### Use AI Notetaker in an online meeting

1. In the **Online Meeting** dialog:
   * Check your **microphone** input.
   * Turn on **Also share audio** so Doraverse can hear voices from the meeting.
   * Under **Real-time Translation (BETA)**, set **Translate into** to your target language if you want live translation. Leave it **Off** if you only need transcription and notes.
2. Click **Start Record**.
3. Your browser will ask what you want to share:
   * Choose the **browser tab**, **window**, or **entire screen** where your online meeting is happening.
   * Turn on **Also share system audio** (or similar option) so the meeting sound is captured.
   * Click **Share**.

You will be taken to the meeting tab. When you return to Doraverse, you’ll see the recording status and, if enabled, the real-time translation panel.

### Use AI Notetaker in an in-person meeting

1. In the **In-Person Meeting** dialog:
   * Select your **microphone**.
   * Under **Real-time Translation (BETA)**, choose your target language if you want live translation, or keep it **Off**.
2. Click **Start Record** and place your device where it can clearly capture everyone’s voice.

Doraverse will start recording and, if enabled, translating your conversation in real time.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (25).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Track your recording and real-time translation

While the meeting is being recorded, you’ll see a recording bar at the top of the screen:

* **Recording bar:** Shows that audio is being captured and displays elapsed time.
* **Pause:** Temporarily pause the recording at any time.

If you turned on real-time translation:

* A panel on the right shows:
  * The **original transcript** as speakers talk.
  * The **translated text** in your chosen language.
* You can switch between **Bilingual**, **Translation only**, and **Original** views to focus on what you need.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you did not enable real-time translation:

* You will only see the **Recording** bar.
* Translation can still be applied later when you generate notes by choosing an output language.

### Finish a recording and generate meeting notes

1. When the meeting ends, click **Pause** on the recording bar.
2. You’ll see options to:
   * **Delete** the recording if you don’t want to keep this session.
   * **Generate notes** to create a structured recap from the conversation.
3. Click **Generate notes**. A configuration dialog will appear:
   * **Output Language:** Choose the language you want your meeting notes to be written in.
   * **Notify me via Email:** Turn this on if you want AI Notetaker to send the meeting note to your inbox.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (28).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

4. Click **Generate notes** again to confirm.

Doraverse will process the recording and create:

* A full transcript.
* Structured notes of the discussion.
* Suggested action items (if applicable).

If you enabled email notification, a copy of the meeting note will be sent to your registered email automatically.

### Review and refine

* **Add tags** (e.g: team, project, quarter) to keep sessions organized and easy to find later.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-11-14 at 12.36.27.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **In Notes:** Edit the meeting notes directly — tighten wording, highlight decisions or add context.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Edit Notes.gif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **In Transcript:** Update speaker to fix any mislabels.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Edit transcript.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Copy the full transcript or notes when you need to share.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-11-14 at 11.54.42.png" alt="" width="230"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **In Action Items:** Review the AI’s next steps suggestions, edit titles and details, choose assignees, set deadlines, and add more tasks as needed.&#x20;

Everything is fully editable, so you can make it work the way your team does.

* **Copy notes or transcript**

All sharing options are available from the meeting action menu.
