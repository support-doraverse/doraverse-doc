## Plan Overview

We offer plan options that fit how you work and who you work with:

* **Individuals (Starter, Pro)** — for one person; best for solo use and personal work. Each plan includes **1 seat** and a fixed amount of **monthly credits**.
* **Business** — for teams and organizations; includes multiple seats, and each seat comes with its own monthly credits so your total credits scale with the number of seats.

For the latest plan options, inclusions, and pricing, check our [**Pricing page**](https://doraverse.com/pricing).

## Seat Adjustment (Business Plan)

Seat adjustments are only available on the Business plan. Individuals plans (Starter, Pro) always include 1 seat and do not support additional seats.

### **Included seats**

On the **Business plan**, you pay per seat. Each workspace must have **at least 3 seats**, and you can add or remove seats in **Admin Settings → Billing → Overview → Adjust seats.**

Each seat on the Business plan includes its own monthly credits, so both your total cost and monthly credits scale with the number of seats.

### Increase seats

* Additional seats are charged immediately.
* If you add seats mid-cycle, the seat price is **prorated** for the days remaining in the current billing cycle.

<details>

<summary><strong>What is a Prorated Charge?</strong></summary>

A prorated charge means you pay only for the portion of the billing cycle that the extra seat was in use.&#x20;

For example, if you add a seat halfway through the month, you are charged only for those remaining days, not the full month.

</details>

* Each extra seat increases your monthly seat charges and adds additional monthly credits, because Business plans grant credits per seat.

> **Monthly credits =&#x20;**<mark style="color:$info;">**Number of seats × Price per seat**</mark>

<details>

<summary>Calculation example</summary>

**Business plan terms:**

* Price per seat: **$25/seat/month**
* Minimum seats: **3 seats**
* Billing day: **30th of each month**

**Current billing cycle:** Jun 30 → Jul 29

**Current seats:** 3 seats (already billed for this cycle)

**Jul 10:** You add **2 seats** (days remaining: **20/30**)

1.  **Prorated charge for added seats (charged immediately):**

    `2 seats × $25 × 20/30 = $33.33` (rounded to the nearest cent on your invoice)
2. **Next renewal (Jul 30):**
   * **Workspace total seats:** `3 (existing) + 2 (added) = 5 seats`
   * **Monthly seat charges:** `5 seats × $25 = $125/month` _(excluding applicable taxes)_
   * **Monthly credits:** increase in proportion to the total number of seats; with 5 seats, your workspace receives more monthly credits than it did with 3 seats, because credits are allocated per seat on the Business plan.

</details>

### Decrease seats vs. remove members

* Removing a member does not reduce your paid seat count. The seat remains **available to reassign** until the end of the current cycle.
* To decrease seats, update the seat quantity in **Billing → Adjust seats**. The change is scheduled for your next renewal. No refunds for the current cycle.

***

## Types of Credit

Doraverse uses three credit types. They are used in this order: **Free credit → Monthly credit → Prepaid credit**.

### **Free Credit**

* Earned via Doraverse's promotions: trials, referrals or exclusive campaigns.
* Has an expiration (see in **Billing**).

### **Monthly Credit**

* Included with your subscription plan.
* The amount of monthly credits depends on your current plan (Starter, Pro, or Business). See details on the [Pricing page](https://doraverse.com/pricing).
* Reset at the start of each billing cycle. Unused monthly credits don’t roll over.

### **Prepaid Credit**

* Purchased via one-time top-ups.
* Stay available as long as the workspace exists.
* Non-refundable.

### When credits run out

If your workspace runs out of credits, AI features become unavailable. Access resumes when your monthly credits reset at the start of the next billing cycle **or** when you top up with Prepaid credits.

Don’t worry — we’ll email you when your credits are running low so you have time to top up before anything pauses.

## Change Plans

Workspace Owner and Billing role can switch plans any time. Before confirming, review how the change affects members, seats, and billing.

### **Moving to Business plan**

* **Seats & members:** Multi-seat support turns on and you can add member anytime.
* **Admin access:** Unlock full Admin Settings — Reporting (user activity & model usage), Member Management, and Workspace Settings (branding, custom domain, etc.).
* **Billing:** Charge applies immediately. Mid-cycle changes are prorated for the remaining days; any unused amount is credited to your account balance and applied to your next invoice.
* **Credits:** Monthly credits reset to the new plan. Prepaid/free credits remain.

### **Moving to an Individuals plan**

* **Seats & members:** The person who confirms the plan change remains in the workspace (as Owner); all other members are removed immediately and lose access. The workspace seat count is set to 1.
* **Admin access & workspace management:**
  * Advanced workspace management features such as **Workspace management system, Role-based permissions, Team Members, Custom branding, Department management, and Custom domain** are removed.
  * You **still keep access to the Report dashboard** (model, user, and credit usage), but it is limited to your individual activity and workspace usage.
  * Any team- or department-based configurations tied to these removed features will no longer be available.
* **Billing:** Charge applies immediately. Mid-cycle changes are prorated for the remaining days; any unused amount is credited to your account balance and applied to your next invoice.
* **Credits:** Monthly credits reset to the new plan. Prepaid/free credits remain.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important:** These changes are not auto-restored if you switch back later. All removed members’ data will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.
{% endhint %}

## Cancel Subscription

Canceling schedules your subscription to end at the end of the current billing cycle. Until that date, your workspace remains fully usable.\
You can undo a scheduled cancellation any time before it takes effect in **Billing**.

***

## Billing & Invoices

### **Payment processing**

All payments are handled securely by **Stripe**. Doraverse does not store sensitive card data. You can manage everything in **Account → Admin Settings → Billing**.

### **When you’re charged:**

* **Subscription start/renewal:** Charged on your billing day.&#x20;
* **Change plan:** Charged immediately upon confirmation (prorated if mid-cycle); any unused amount is credited to your account balance and applied to your next invoice.
* **Add more seats:** Charged immediately (prorated if mid-cycle).
* **Top up prepaid credit:** Charged at purchase.

### **Pricing and taxes**&#x20;

All prices are shown and charged in **USD**. Plan prices are **exclusive of tax** — any applicable tax is added at checkout based on your billing address.

For common billing countries:

* **Vietnam: Tax rate 10%**
* **Japan: Tax rate 10%**
* **United Kingdom (UK): Tax rate 20%**

The exact tax amount is calculated and displayed before you confirm payment.

### Failed payments

* **Immediate charges** (e.g., Prepaid top-ups, adding seats, upgrades charged now): If the charge fails, the purchase does not complete and no changes are applied. Update your payment method in **Billing** and try again.
* **Subscription renewals:** If the charge fails, we’ll retry automatically and notify you by email. If payment is still unsuccessful after the retry window, your workspace is paused until payment is completed. Access is restored immediately once the payment goes through.

### Manage Billing & Invoices

Go to **Account → Admin Settings → Billing**.\
From there, open **Manage Billing** to:

* View current subscription.
* Update payment methods.
* Update billing details.
* View & download invoice history (invoices and receipts).

> **Who can manage billing:** Only Workspace Owners and Billing role users can view and change these settings.
